       <h2> <strong>CPS STUDENTS LAUNCH THINK-TANK</strong></h2>
        <p>CHICAGO 10/01 -- Chicago, despite being the third largest city in the U.S. and having access to multi-million dollar investments, is struggling with issues ranging from gun violence, to institutionalized racism. The political atmosphere and bureaucracy often directly impacts Chicago&rsquo;s students education -- a critical factor that can transform communities and reduce violent crime, while providing a foundation for social and economic mobility.</p>

        <p>In order to help bring about positive change for themselves and their communities, Chicago students are taking matters into their own hands, and are launching an education policy think-tank.</p>

        <p>The Student Policy Council (SPC) is student-led, nonprofit, nonpartisan policy research and development center that aims to offer practical solutions to educational issues.</p>

        <p>The SPC will be releasing multiple policy proposals to address a range of issues, from racial and sexual justice to funding for education. In addition to policy proposals, the SPC also plans to conduct studies and aggregate existing data while working with legislators and education experts to implement equitable education policies.</p>

        <p>The first student-developed policy proposal, ProgressED is scheduled for release on October first, and will primarily address democracy in education and students&rsquo; rights.</p>
